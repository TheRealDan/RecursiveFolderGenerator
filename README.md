# FAQ
Q: What does this do?

A: It creates a bunch of folders inside of each other, each with a random (and somewhat pronounceable) name.


Q: Can I choose where the folders are output to?

A: The folders are created relative to the .jar's location, so you could move the .jar before running it to determine exactly where you want the folders to be created.


Q: Is there a limit to the amount of folders it can create?

A: The application will only accept a number between 1 and 1,000
